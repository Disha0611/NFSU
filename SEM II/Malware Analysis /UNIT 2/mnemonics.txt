the two operands multiplies and stores the result in the first operand but the first operand must be a register.
the three operand form multiplies second and third operands and stores the result in the first operand, the first operand must be a register and the third operand is restricted to be a constant.

  imul 	<reg> <reg>
	<reg> <mem>
	<reg> <reg> <const>
	<reg> <mem> <sonst>
	<reg> <const> <sonst>

the idev instruction divides the contents of the 64-bit register edx:eax by the specified operand value. the quotient result of the division is stored into eax while the remainder is placed in edx. 

1. write a c program
2. create its .exe file
3. disassemble it (.exe) using IDAFree
4. analyze

void main c
{
printf ("Hello World!");
}

program 2 - with 2 printf statements 

compare the two programs for new lines added in assembly code 

program 3 - int a; add to original program 2
program 4 - int a=0; add to original program 3
